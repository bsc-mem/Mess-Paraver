# Libs

This project depends on the paraver-kernel for trace parsing, as well as an older version of the The **PROFiling-based EsTimation of performance and energy (PROFET)** tool (https://github.com/bsc-mem/PROFET). This tool was the first to integrate Mess plotting logic, and was used at the time to integrate with the Paraver kernel.
